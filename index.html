            <div class="service">
                <h3>C++</h3>
                <p>Most of my school projects were done using C++. It was the primary language used
                    in a majority of my classes. I even wrote my first ever HelloWorld program using C++.
                    I was introduced to programming fundamentals and the applications
                    we were tasked to complete were designed to help us further understand computer 
                    architecture and hardware design.
                </p>
            </div> <!-- service -->

            <div class="service">
                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>I started learning Java on my own because I believe it is beneficial to familiarize myself with a wide variety of languages. I took a class in Java as an elective
                    and learned about object oriented programming and the importance of it in real world
                    applications. Java is now my perferred programming language, and I continue to expand
                    my knowledge of Java by completing hackerrank challenges online to elevate my problem solving skills.

            <div class="service">
                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>I used python when working on data visualization projects, especially the PANDAS
                    library. Being able to create a new Jupytr Notebook and start programing using python to import,
                    edit, delete, and analyze data was something I thoroughly enjoyed. I have not experimented with
                    python outside of data visualization, but I plan on working on some python projects in the near
                    future.

                <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
                <p>This is what I used to create this website. I have some experience with HTML and CSS in the past,
                    but only on small group projects that were presented in class using the live server extension on
                    Visual Studio Code. I enjoyed revisitng these tools to aid in the development of this website application.

        <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">ASPIRING SOFTWARE DEVELOPER</p>

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>I graduated from Northern Illinois University in spring 2022 with a bachelor's
                degree in computer science with an emphasis in software development. I have experience working in Java, C++, HTML, CSS,
                MySQL, Python, and Git. Although I have not had the opportunity of participating
                in an internship during college, I am passionate about my profession, and I continue to work on
                my own projects to enhance and expand my programming knowledge.</p>
            <p>Programming is more than a job to me, it's a hobby. One that I enjoy and am excited about doing professionaly in my near future. I 
                look forward to joining a community full of experienced developers and tech professionals, and learn from them about producing
                cutting edge software solutions and applications. I am a quick learner and open to all opportunties within the tech industry.</p>
